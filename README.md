# Template-Project
R&amp;D Template Project A reusable structure for experimenting with libraries and frameworks, featuring virtual environments, dependency management, and testing. Licensed under MIT.

# R&D Project Template

This template is designed to provide a structured environment for experimenting with new libraries and frameworks. It includes a pre-configured virtual environment setup, dependency management, environment variable handling, and a testing framework to streamline research and development.

---

## Features  

- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment using `venv`.
- **Dependency Management**: Manage libraries with `requirements.txt`.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure and organized handling of sensitive data with `.env`.
- **Testing**: Preconfigured setup for testing using `pytest`.
- **Reusable Structure**: Consistent and reusable project layout for all R&D experiments.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Template
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/template-project.git
cd template-project
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Edit `.env` with your environment-specific values:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   DEBUG=True
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///test.db
   ```

### 5. Run the Application
Modify `src/main.py` as needed for your library or framework testing, then execute:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### 6. Run Tests
Place your test files in the `tests/` directory and execute:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### 7. Add New Dependencies
1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install <package-name>
   ```
2. Update `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
